I document this filth purely for academic completeness. That the Common tongue has absorbed certain Goblish obscenities—\"thrack\" being the most notorious—makes this work regrettably necessary.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nModern Goblish represents the most catastrophic linguistic devolution ever documented.

The fragment known as \"Melka's Lament\"—recorded during the extraordinary Thistlecross Encounter between the hero Aldric and the goblin healer Melka—represents perhaps our final glimpse into authentic female goblinoid erotic-spiritual expression before its inevitable extinction.\n\nThe term \"Skulgaroth\" requires immediate attention. My colleague Dr. Bramblethorne translates it as mere \"Deathbringer,\" but this is criminally reductive. In Old Goblin texts (see my *Codex Viridis*, plates XVII-XXIII), \"Skulga\" appears not simply as death but as *transformation through ending*—the death that births. \"Roth\" carries dual meaning: both \"bringer\" and \"beloved.\" Thus Skulgaroth becomes something untranslatable: \"Beloved-Who-Brings-The-Death-That-Transforms.\" That goblin females would name a human male thus speaks to a mythology we have barely begun to comprehend.\n\nThe opening line—*\"Groak Aldric Skulgaroth, zu'uka rhaatark lug\"*—employs the archaic vocative \"groak,\" used exclusively in female goblin religious-erotic verse. This grammatical form died out in male Goblish three generations ago, replaced by the crude \"oi\" or \"grak.\" That Melka preserves it suggests she learned this song not from her contemporaries but from grandmother-texts, the oral traditions passed between the dying female lines.\n\nMost devastating is the phrase *\"z'unn skrizzak\"* (I want/need/claim). Modern male Goblish has seventeen words for \"want\" regarding breeding, all variations of \"take\" or \"mount.\" But \"skrizzak\" appears in the *Songs of the Green Mothers* (sadly, mostly destroyed in the Westmarch Purges) as a word meaning \"to desire with one's entire genealogy\"—want that extends backward through on"}, {"pid": 787, "name": "Missives from the Fortress of Sorrow", "group": "System / Utility", "content": "Diplomatic Mission to the Fortress of SorrowMissive 1[[))]]Missive 2[[))]]Missive 3[[))]]Missive 4[[))]][*In the year of the Griffin, under the reign of King Richard Valarian, a highly sensitive diplomatic mission was organized with the primary objective of establishing a potential peace treaty with the goblin tribes of the region, specifically under the rule of the notorious Grokk the Grand, chieftain of the Fortress of Sorrow.

No crossguard gems, no wind runes, just that mocking inscription burnt into the metal: **ELISE - GOBLIN-OWNED HERO**.\n\nThe balance is gone.

These complex tools serve as both a conduit and a diagnostic instrument, playing an indispensable role in the study and practice of magics ranging from mundane spellcraft to eldritch incantations.\n\n### The Basic Mechanics of Arcanameters\nAt their core, arcanameters operate on the principle of resonance, attuning to the ambient magical fields and fluctuations within their vicinity. By harmonizing with these energies, the device can gauge the intensity, type, and even potential trajectory of the magical currents. Most arcanameters consist of the following key components:\n\n- **Resonance Crystal**: Typically the heart of an arcanameter, these crystals are meticulously worked from rare, magically conductive minerals. Pyrathine Crystals are a popular choice due to their exceptional sensitivity and durability.\n- **Runic Inscription**: Intricate patterns and glyphs are etched or inlaid upon the surface of the resonator to aid in energy calibration and amplification. These inscriptions vary based on the arcanameter's intended use and the traditions of its craftsperson.\n- **Ethereal Conduits**: These channels within the arcanameter direct and focus the energy, allowing the user to measure more precisely or exert control over the magical forces.\n\n### Types of Arcanameters\n1. **Basic Arcanameter**: Used primarily by apprentices and novices, these devices offer fundamental functions—such as detecting magical fields and minor manifestations. While not overly intricate, they serve as essential learning tools.\n\n2. **Intermediate Arcanameter**: These versatile instruments provide deeper insights and capabilities, often incorporating modular components that can be swapped out to tailor the arcanameter"}, {"pid": 800, "name": "Armor", "group": "System / Utility", "content": "The Slave-Knight's Vestments\n\n**Origin:** Transformation artifact (involuntary)\n**Material:** Voidscale - metal unknown to mortal smiths\n**Coverage:** Ceremonial (estimated 8% of body surface)\n**Protection value:** None measurable\n\nWhen the Collar of Maraan transforms a warrior, it wreaks changes upon armor as surely as upon flesh. What was once honest steel—breastplate and mail, greaves and gauntlets fitted for battle—becomes the Slave-Knight's Vestments, a cruel parody that mocks the very concept of protection.\n\nThe Vestments consist of three pieces, if pieces they can be called. Two triangular scales, each no larger than a child's palm, connected by chains of black metal fine as hair, serve to barely contain the breast. A single strip of the same scaled metal, narrow as a blade's edge, spans from waist to woman's cleft, disappearing between the haunches. The boots alone retain some semblance of their former purpose, though perverted—rising past the knee in articulated scales, they terminate in spikes that force the wearer to mince upon her toes like a court dancer.\n\n**Properties**\n\nThe Voidscale responds not to its wearer but to its master. Where the transformed hero must struggle with clasps that hide beneath flesh and hooks that multiply when touched, the collar's bearer need only gesture for the scales to part like water. The metal runs always cold against skin, save when its wearer feels shame—then it burns without leaving marks.\n\nMost peculiar is the Vestments' weight.

These arcane artifacts facilitate instantaneous vocal message transmission over vast distances, akin to speaking through vast ethereal corridors to reach the intended recipient promptly. Each Tellstone is meticulously crafted to serve as both a secure and an expedient means of communication, especially crucial in times of dire need or during significant events.\n\n**Manufacturing Process:**\nThe creation of a Tellstone is a complex process, combining ancient magical craftsmanship with the more arcane technologies known to a select group of Thuulk's wizards. The process involves several critical stages:\n\n1. **Mineral Harvesting:** The core material for a Tellstone is Pyrathine Crystal, a rare mineral renowned for its inherent magical properties and its ability to conduct arcane energies. The crystal is mined from the deepest veins of the Ironspike Mountains, where it is believed the stones are imbued with the residual magic from the ancient celestial alignments.\n\n2. **Refining and Shaping:** Once harvested, the raw Pyrathine Crystals are transported to the Arcane Forge in Thuulk. Here, under a confluence of ley lines, each crystal is carefully refined and cut into smaller, perfectly rounded stones. This process is delicate, requiring the steadied precision of skilled gem cutters combined with minor enchantments to maintain the stone's magical conductivity.\n\n3. **Enchantment Binding:** The pivotal stage involves master enchanters imbuing each rounded crystal with a series of sophisticated communication spells. This process is performed under strict ritualistic conditions, often during specific astrological events, to enhance the stone’s receptive and projective capacities.

Derived from primordial utterances that predate known history, Thraan-vek remains one of the most complex and least understood languages studied by modern cryptolinguists.\n\n**1. Phonological and Morphological Characteristics:**\nThraan-vek is characterized by its deep, resonant tonality and a unique phonetic structure that includes hard, forceful consonants and elongated vowels. These vowels often stretch into eerie echoes that imbue the language with a sense of otherworldly dread and profound authority. The language's rhythm is cadential, almost chant-like, which suggests an intrinsic tie to ritualistic uses.\n\n**2. Syntax and Grammar:**\nThraan-vek does not conform to traditional syntactical rules known in human languages. It employs a structure that is deeply associative, where thematic elements are bound together in triads, creating complex webs of meaning through seemingly simple sentences. This triadic pattern suggests an understanding of the universe as fundamentally tripartite—comprising creation, preservation, and destruction.\n\n**3. Semantic Fields:**\nThe language focuses heavily on themes of power, control, and dominion. Commonly used terms include:\n\n- **VELAK** (Power)\n- **ZETRA** (Dominate)\n- **RAZAN** (Obey)\n\nThese terms frequently appear alongside names of ancient entities, weaving a narrative of cosmic control and submission directly into the fabric of spoken and written discourse.\n\n**4.

He is manipulative, always seeking to expand his knowledge and power, even if it means stepping over others.\n\n**Abilities and Powers:**\n- **Dark Shamanism:** Skilled in the forbidden arts of goblin shamanism, able to invoke curses, manipulate energies, and summon minor demons from the nether planes.\n- **Potion Crafting:** An expert alchemist, Grouz can concoct potions that heal, enhance, or poison, depending on his whim or need.\n- **Mind Manipulation:** Has the ability to cloud minds, sow confusion, or instill fear in his adversaries, making him a dangerous foe even without physical confrontation.\n\n**Background:**\nGrouz's origins are murky, with rumors suggesting he was once an adviser to a goblin warlord in the eastern badlands. After a betrayal left him wandering, he amassed arcane knowledge from forbidden sources, eventually finding a patron in Grokk who values his dark arts and strategic mind.\n\n**Exploits:**\n- **Curse of the Endless Thirst:** Infamously caused an entire human battalion to turn on each other by inducing an insatiable thirst that could not be quenched by any drink.\n- **Manipulation of the Blood Moon:** Altered the course of a battle by turning the moon red, driving Grokk’s warriors into a frenzy that led to a gruesome victory.\n- **Creation of th"}, {"pid": 807, "name": "Macros", "group": "System / Utility", "content": "(set: to (macro: str-type _passage,\n\n))\n\n(set: to )\n\n)", "tags": ["header"]}, {"pid": 808, "name": "Sidebar", "group": "System / Utility", "content": "<nav class=\"side-stack menu vertical\">\n\nRead[]\nRead\n\nBack\nBack\n\nLore\nLore\n\nMenu\nMenu\n\n</nav>\n\n)", "tags": ["footer"]}, {"pid": 809, "name": "Snib's Hut", "group": "System / Utility", "content": "Snib's Hut\n\n**The Goblin's Hovel at the Edge of Nowhere**\n\nThree hours west of Eboncrest, where the Everbloom's last pines surrender to sand, squats a structure that insults the word \"shelter.\" Built against a dead olive tree like a drunk leaning on a corpse, the hut defies gravity through spite alone.\n\n**Construction (If You Can Call It That)**\n\nMud-brick walls and wood, patched with dried dung and what might be bones—don't look too close. The roof sags under stolen Eboncrest mill-planks, their maker's marks still visible. Hide flaps serve as doors, reeking of old piss. Through gaps in the walls, you can see piles of rags, bones, and trophies best left unexamined.\n\nInside: one room, twenty feet of concentrated misery. Crusty furs piled in the corner (his bed).

The glans, already disproportionately large (typically 2.5 inches in diameter), pushes through the dilated cervix into the uterine cavity. Once past this threshold, the glans immediately begins to expand laterally.\n\nThe mechanism resembles a mushroom cap spreading, or perhaps a shield boss flattening from within. The glans tissue, comprised of specialized erectile chambers absent in human anatomy, inflates to nearly four inches in width while simultaneously flattening to less than an inch thick. This creates what can only be described as a flesh-seal inside the womb itself.\n\nImage: The glans only deflates after complete testicular drainage.\n**The Lock Mechanism:**\n\nThe expanded glans becomes physically impossible to withdraw through the cervix. Any attempt at separation causes the flattened tissue to pull against the uterine walls, creating suction that draws the cervix tighter around the shaft. The female is quite literally impaled from within.\n\nDuring one particularly horrific observation, I witnessed a goblin take an arrow through the heart mid-copulation. Despite immediate death, the locked glans continued its biological function. The corpse remained attached to the screaming maiden for nearly twenty minutes as the dead goblin's reproductive system, operating on autonomous nerve clusters, completed ejaculation. The glans only released post-mortem when hydraulic pressure finally decreased.\n\nThe \"lock\" serves three documented purposes"}, {"pid": 811, "name": "Zaelasia", "group": "System / Utility", "content": "Zaelasia\n\n**The Known World**\n\nFive lands under one sky, each nursing its own grudges. The Telenil count centuries in their Everbloom depths. Dwarves hammer fate in the Ironspikes. Sandwalkers read tomorrow in desert bones. The Isle of Mists keeps secrets even from its own sorcerers. And at the heart—Valaria, where humans breed and scheme and call it civilization.\n\n**Valaria**\n\nKing Richard Valarian rules from Thuulk's golden spires, spending northern silver on southern wars. Fertile enough to feed armies; rich enough to hire them; proud enough to waste both on Sirath's bloody shores - the kingdom stretches from the Telenil marches to the desert's edge, every league mapped, taxed, and bled for. They worship the Triad here—past, present, and future dressed up as gods—while older powers sleep uneasily beneath worked stone.\n\n**The War**\n\nSirath squats across the narrow sea like a wound that won't heal. Three generations of Valarian kings have thrown men at those beaches. Three generations of widows curse their names. The war feeds itself now—honor debts and blood prices, the machinery of vengeance grinding forward because no one remembers how to stop. Every spring, the recruiting sergeants come. Every autumn, fewer come back.\n\n**What Stirs Beneath**\n\nThe old darkness has names: Maraan the Dreamer, Thul'nara of the Thousand Teeth, others best forgotten. Their temples lie broken from the Ironspikes to the Isle, their priests centuries dead. But dead gods dream, and dreamers sometimes wake. In Thuulk's libraries, scholars translate what shouldn't be read. In desert ruins, treasure hunters break seals that were meant to last forever.\n\n**The Truth of It**\n\nZaelasia pretends at unity—five fingers of the same hand, the diplomats say. But the Telenil close their borders tighter each year. The dwarves sell weapons to all sides. The Sandwalkers raid where they please. The Isle's sorcerers answer to none but themselves.
